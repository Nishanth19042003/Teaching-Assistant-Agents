# Teaching-Assistant-Agents
The Teaching Assistant Agents project introduces a suite of AI-driven agents designed to enhance educational experiences by assisting both educators and learners. Each agent is specialized for a distinct educational role:

Professor Agent: Focuses on building a comprehensive knowledge base for any topic, starting from first principles to advanced concepts. It creates well-structured, easy-to-read Google Docs for learners and researchers.

Academic Advisor Agent: Develops detailed learning roadmaps by breaking topics into logical subtopics arranged in a progressive order. It estimates time commitments for each section and presents the roadmap in a structured format within Google Docs.

Research Librarian Agent: Curates high-quality learning resources using search tools like SerpApi. It provides lists of blogs, repositories, documentation, tutorials, and courses, complete with descriptions and quality assessments.

Teaching Assistant Agent: Creates practice materials such as exercises, quizzes, hands-on projects, and real-world applications aligned with the learning roadmap. Detailed solutions and explanations are provided in Google Docs for clarity.
